Weather App Built on SwiftUI
This project is a passion project one I've wanted to do for years now. The intention is to use Darksky as the API but until i can afford it the application will be built with it's future using in mind
DAY 1: Really just getting an idea of how i want the Welcome screen to approcouch you, heavy on colors and animations. This should feel like an experience for a new user
